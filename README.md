# .NET 6 Web API with OpenIddict

This is a sample .NET 6 Web API project that demonstrates how to integrate OpenIddict for authentication and authorization using Minimal API.
Minimal API provides a simpler syntax for defining routes and handling requests, which can lead to more efficient development.


## Prerequisites
Before you get started, ensure that you have the following installed:

.NET 6 SDK

## Getting Started

Install the required packages:

```bash
dotnet restore
```
Build and run the project:

```bash
dotnet run
```
The API should now be running on https://localhost:5001.

## OpenIddict
This project uses OpenIddict for authentication and authorization. 

OpenIddict is a flexible and easy-to-use OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 server for .NET. 
It supports a wide range of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect flows, including authorization code, client credentials, resource owner password credentials, and refresh token flows.

### Features
- Integration with ASP.NET Core Identity and Entity Framework Core 
- Support for both OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect protocols
- Support for multiple databases, including SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and MySQL
- Customizable token and authorization code format
- User-friendly error messages
- Comprehensive documentation and samples


### Configuration
1. Add the OpenIddict services to the DI container:
```csharp
services.AddOpenIddict()
    .AddCore(options =>
    {
        options.UseEntityFrameworkCore()
            .UseDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>();
    })
    .AddServer(options =>
    {
        options.SetAccessTokenLifetime(TimeSpan.FromHours(1))
            .SetRefreshTokenLifetime(TimeSpan.FromDays(30))
            .AllowPasswordFlow()
            .AllowAuthorizationCodeFlow()
            .AllowRefreshTokenFlow()
            .AddEphemeralSigningKey();
    })
    .AddValidation(options =>
    {
        options.UseLocalServer();
    });
```
2. Configure the OpenIddict middleware:
```csharp
app.UseRouting();

app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();

app.UseOpenIddict();
```
### Usage
To use OpenIddict, you'll need to create clients, scopes, and applications. Here's an example of how to create a client:
```csharp
var client = new OpenIddictApplicationDescriptor
            {
                ClientId = "console_app",
                ClientSecret = "secret",
                DisplayName = "Application Console",
                Permissions =
                {
                    OpenIddictConstants.Permissions.Endpoints.Authorization,
                    OpenIddictConstants.Permissions.Endpoints.Token,
                    OpenIddictConstants.Permissions.GrantTypes.Password,
                    OpenIddictConstants.Permissions.GrantTypes.RefreshToken,
                    OpenIddictConstants.Permissions.ResponseTypes.Code,
                    OpenIddictConstants.Permissions.Scopes.Email,
                    OpenIddictConstants.Permissions.Scopes.Profile,
                    OpenIddictConstants.Permissions.Scopes.Roles,
                    OpenIddictConstants.Permissions.Prefixes.Scope + "api1"
                }
            };
await manager.CreateAsync(client);
```

## API Endpoints
This sample project includes the following API endpoints:


- POST /connect/token - Get an access token with the following parameters:
    - With password grant type:
        - *grant_type= password*
        - *username= <your_username>*
        - *password= <your_password>*
        - *client_id= <client_id>*
        - *client_secret= <client_secret>*

    - With refresh_token grant type:
        - *grant_type= refresh_token*
        - *client_id= <client_id>*
        - *client_secret= <client_secret>*
        - *refresh_token= <your_refresh_token>*

The response will include an access token, which you can then use to access the API endpoints.

- GET /authorize - Return user identity name from access token
